FIX MY CODE

Background Context;

Fix my code is a new type of project, where I was expected jump into an existing code base and fix it!

Sometimes you will know the language, sometimes not.

In this project, I downloaded this https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/rq-j1VNUKRTQoADfDRXJmg repository and used it as initial files for all solutions.

I did not recode everything but just fixed the error in the codebase!
